# golfcv

This is a swing coach/analyzer using OpenCV and Mediapipe

This is a work in progress. Some things I'd like to implement in the future:
  - Automatic swing feedback by analyzing wiremesh diagram
  - Upload multiple videos to compare swing to that of a better golfer
  - Plot wiremesh using NumPy array
  - Slice/hook/shank classifier from raw swing (no ball)
